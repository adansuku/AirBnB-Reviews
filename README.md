# AirBnB-Reviews
This plugin allows you to import listing reviews from AirBnB into WordPress.

By default, listings are imported as posts but there are a few hooks that
you can use to customize the import process. Check the code to find them and how
to use them.

USAGE

Once you activated the plugin you will find a new "AirBnB Reviews" entry in the "Settings" menu or click on "Settings" in the installed plugins list. The page will ask you for your AirBnB API Key and the update frequency of the reviews you want to import.

FAIR WARNING & DISCLAIMER

This plugin uses the AirBnB private API and thus, if you are an AirBnB user, you will probably violate the AirBnB terms of services by using it.

You will also violate AirBnB intellectual property if you use it to download and distribute verified photos (those pictures that have been taken by a photograph AirBnB send for free).

As such you are solely responsible for using this plugin. This developer will not be liable for any damages you may suffer in connection with using, modifying, or distributing this plugin. In particular, this developer will not be liable for any loss of revenue you may incur if your AirBnB account is suspended following your use of this plugin.
